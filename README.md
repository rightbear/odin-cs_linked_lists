# odin-cs_linked_lists

This is the thirteenth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/09) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as objects and linked lists to build two classes and twelve functions to tackle with the linked list problem. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try seperate classes of Node and LinkedList in `classes.js`. I also add basic functions for LinkedList such as insertion, remove, searching, print and so on. Futhermore, I use Node.js command environment to run and debug my functions in `main.js`. This activity strengthens my skills in Node.js and JavaScript.
